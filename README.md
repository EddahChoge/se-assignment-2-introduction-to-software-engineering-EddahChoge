Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

Sytematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools for the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Software engineering entails an array of methods, principles and tools in the software development life cycle whereas traditional programming focuses mainly on pure coding.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) comprises of several phases such as: Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment and Maintenance.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Requirements phase - Collecting data based on the client's preferences and requirements.
Design phase - Visualizing how the software will appear on the client's end factoring in the time budget of the given project.
Implementation phase - writing code and implementing a variety of principles and methods.
Testing phase - involves carrying out various tests to check whether the software meets the threshold as per the client's requirements.
Deployment phase - where the software is successfully installes into the client's system, after ensuring it's up to standard.
Maintenance phase - this phase seeks to ensure routine maintenance is carried out on the software system developed; to ensure it's up to date.
Agile model is a development methodology which guides software development by embracing an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.
Waterfall model is also a development methodology which guides software development through sequential approach with distinct stages.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:

Both Agile and Waterfall models are software methodologies that guide software development.
Key differences are Agile model focuses more on the concept of 'building as you go' meaning it has a scalable approach which embraces flexibility hence more suitable for long projects whereas Waterfall model tends to be more rigid as it focuses more on following the sequence where a developer can't move to the next stage until the first stage is completed hence suitable for short projects.

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

Requirements engineering is the process of analyzing, validating, and managing the needs or expectations of clients in a software development project. It ensures that the developed software meets the functional and non-functional requirements of the users.
Process of requirements engineering consists of: gathering, analysis, validation and management of requirements.
The importance of SDLC is that it provides a clear & solid foundation on the trajectory of a software project, eliminates ambiguity & confusion, improves software quality and supports decision making.
Software Design Principles revolve around Encapsulation, Abstraction and Modularity.


Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Modularity in software design entails creating modular components that can be independently designed, implemented, and tested to facilitate code reuse and maintainability.
It improves scalability of softwares by ensuring modular components are configures in such a way they can facilitate code reuse in different projects.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

Testing is crucial as it enables developers to know whether the software they have created is up to standard and incorporates the right functionality for the end user. There are levels to Software Testing:
Unit Testing - testing of individuals units of code.
Integration Testing - testing the interactions between different units/modules.
System Testing - testing entire system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing - testing system from end user's perspective.

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Version Control Systems are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordination work among tema members.
One of the popular version control systems is Git which incorporates features such as branching, commit and many others.

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Some of the roles of a software project manager are:
Team management. 
Project planning.
Communication to be in the loop aboout the project status.
Change management and financial management.
Key responsibilities in managing software projects are:
Effective communication.
Incorporating agile methodologies.
Prioritization of tasks
Regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.
Challenges faced in managing software projects:
Changing requirements by the client.
Tight deadlines
Technical debt i.e. inadequate technical tools to achieve a certain modulein client's requirements.

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

Software maintenance is the process of updating, modifying, and repairing existing software systems to keep them functional and aligned with evolving requirements.
Different types of software maintenanace:
Corrective.
Adaptive.
Perfective.

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

Ethical Issues Software Engineers face: Privacy concerns & security concerns.
Ensuring Adherence to Ethical Standards: Establish ethical guidelines, Promote ethical awareness and a culture of transparency.
